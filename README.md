# ansible
Repo to store all my ansible roles

Requirement for dev enviornment:
  - VirtualBox
    - VirtualBox extension pack 
  - Vagrant
    - Vagrant Plugins 
      - landrush
      - vagrant-vbguest

To modify the vagrant hosts, just edit `vagrant/vagrant-hosts.yaml` file.

# DISCLAIMER
So far all ansible roles are just for ubuntu 20.04, maybe they are also working with earlier ubuntu versions.
